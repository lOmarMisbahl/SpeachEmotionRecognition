# SpeachEmotionRecognition : Speech is the most natural way of expressing ourselves as humans. It is only natural then to extend this communication medium to computer applications. We define speech emotion recognition (SER) systems as a collection of methodologies that process and classify speech signals to detect the embedded emotions. In this project we used convolutional neural networks (1D & 2D) using energies and spectrograms as feature spaces.
